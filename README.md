### Context

The data has been scraped from Playstore website using Selenium script. The data is in raw format with Full review content from each user.
The Data can be used to perform Classification and Clustering into multiple label set (UX, Bug, Other..) after manually labelling the data. The reviews generally talk about the sentiment of the user, but it holds different set of information about the application which is very essential for the App developers. The goal from this data is to identify the reviews nature and sort out the reviews that can be used in productive nature.

This data was a trial run for the script and to identify if the application (IKEA) has the amount of reviews that can be categorized to perform Classification and build a generalized model.
